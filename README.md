# 2021-2022-UROP-Marsh-Research

My name is Andy, and I a Civil Engineering student at UC Berkeley. During my third year, I had the opportunity to work in research. I helped Lukas WinklerPrins, a PhD student, and Mark Stacey, the Civil Engineering department chair, with their research at Whale's Tail Marsh studying wave attenuation in coastal marshes. This research was apart of a bigger research project of the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, CA, with data collected in summer 2021 during some of the highest tides of the year.

My work was to look at data from various sensors at the marsh. The main sensors I dealt with were pressure sensors on the marsh top. There were 6 sensors in total each going more inland. These pressure sensors were able to extrapolate other metrics as well. The metrics I analyzed were significant wave height and depth.
Another sensor that I briefly looked at was the velocity sensor. This sensor records the velocity of the incoming waves in the three dimensions.
